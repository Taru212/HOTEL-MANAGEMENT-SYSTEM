# HOTELMANAGEMENTSYSTEM
The Hotel Management System we will build will be a simple console-based application that allows users to check-ins, check-outs and view the availability of rooms. Menu will provide four options as – check-in, check-out, view occupancy and exit. Scanner class used for taking input from user through keyboard. For check-in user needs to provide room number. Given room number will get checked as it is valid or not and if that room is empty then system will ask for guest name. Check-out process is based on room number. Again, the conditions will get checked for room validation. If room number is valid then assign that room as ‘empty’
